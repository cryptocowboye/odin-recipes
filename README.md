# odin-recipes

Before coding the project:

I will demonstrate what I've learned, thusfar, within the domain of HTML and CSS from The Odin Project. I assume I am making a "quasi-recipe website" and will be providing links, images, stylesheet linking, etc.

After coding the project:

It would seem that I accidentally skipped ahead in my studies (there was no CSS involved)! However, it was a nice bit of practice messing around with HTML boilerplate, uniformity, and ingraining git commands to my knowledge base. On to the next project!
